so we use inheritance type single table but the issue with that is that we cant enforce nullable= false on it
things are bound to be null at some time

table per class
same as mapped super class except parent has a dedicated table

child can inherit the parent class

Joined class:
joined class vs table per class vs mapped super class

inheritance vs composition

@Enumerated gives us the option that we can tell in what data type we want to store the enum

understand in relationships that what needs to be created when order do matters

cascade type basically tells that what need to be saved when that is the upper example of relationship
so cascade manages that and checks what need to be created first irrespective of the flow

in one to one any side can have the foreign key but in one to many many side must have the foreign key
