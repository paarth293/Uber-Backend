so we use inheritance type single table but the issue with that is that we cant enforce nullable= false on it
things are bound to be null at some time

table per class
same as mapped super class except parent has a dedicated table
child can inherit the parent class

Joined class:
joined class vs table per class vs mapped super class

inheritance vs composition
